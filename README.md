# PetSitting-api

This repository will serve as API for the pet sitting app we are making. We can use this file to communicate with eachother.

Questions:
  1. Model/Show: made this advert -> DONE
  2. Model/booking: can we make this the user?
  3. What about pet? is this an extra model that needs to be made?
